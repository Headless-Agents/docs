## Welcome to Headless Agents

Headless Agents is a powerful platform that allows AI agents to be deployed anywhere. 

--------------------------------

## Why use Headless Agents?

- **Platform agnostic deployment**: No matter where your agent is built, it can be deployed to Headless Agents, enabling it to be called from any device or platform.
- **Request schema abstraction**: Pre-configure your agent's request parsing, allowing users to call your agent with a simple string instead of a rigid, custom JSON schema.
- **Context management**: Let users manage conversation context with built-in context management IDs.
- **Consolidated authentication, permissioning, and analytics**: Maintain control over your agent's usage and performance with Headless Agents' authentication, permissioning, and analytics features.
