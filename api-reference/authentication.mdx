All API requests (except `/health`) require authentication using your Headless Agents API key. The API key should be provided in the `X-API-Key` header with each request.

## Getting an API Key

Contact our support team to get your API key. Each API key is unique and should be kept secure.

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header with each request:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" https://api.headlessagents.ai/call/your_agent_id
```

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'X-API-Key': 'your_api_key'
}

response = requests.post(
    'https://api.headlessagents.ai/call/your_agent_id',
    headers=headers,
    json={'request': 'Your request here'}
)
```

## Security Best Practices

1. Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly
2. Rotate your API key periodically
3. Use environment variables to store your API key in applications
4. Monitor your API key usage for any suspicious activity
