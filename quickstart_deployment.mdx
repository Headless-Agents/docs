These steps will guide you through the process of deploying an agent on Headless Agents. 

Before you get started, make sure you sign up for a Headless Agents account at [headlessagents.ai](https://headlessagents.ai).

## Navigate to the deploy module

Navigate from the dashboard to the [deploy module](https://headlessagents.ai/dashboard/deploy).

## Select your deployment type

Select the type of agent you want to deploy:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="browser" title="Standard Deployment" defaultOpen={true}>
    Create a new agent on Headless Agents. <br/>Skip to our [Standard Deployment Quickstart](/quickstart_deployment#standard-deployment-quickstart) to get started.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="house" title="Platform Deployment" defaultOpen={true}>
    Deploy an agent built on another platform or server using webhooks or HTTP requests. Skip to our [Platform Deployment Quickstart](/quickstart_deployment#platform-deployment-quickstart) to get started.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Standard Deployment Quickstart 

We reccomend you deploy one of our pre-built templates to get started. You can deploy the agent in just three clicks from the [deploy module](https://headlessagents.ai/dashboard/deploy).

**1. Select a template from the dropdown menu.**

**2. Test the function provided to the agent, this function will serve as a tool your agent can call if it chooses to.**

  <Accordion icon="code" title="Function Notes" defaultOpen={true}>
    - Agents built on Headless Agents can call python functions. Head over to the [Function Guide](/quickstart_deployment#function-guide) to learn more about function calling on Headless Agents.
    - When the agent calls a function, it runs in a secure, cloud-based sandbox.
    - If your function requires authentication, like an API key, add it to the [Secrets Manager](https://headlessagents.ai/dashboard/secrets) and it will be used by the agent when the function is called. 
    - Visit the [Secrets Manager Guide](/dashboard/secrets) to learn more about how agents work with secrets.
  </Accordion>

**3. When the function test is successful, click 'Deploy Agent'!**
<br/> _Note: If the function test is not successful, you can edit the function and try again._

**Congratulations! You've deployed your first agent.**

Head over to the [Call Agent Guide](/quickstart_deployment#call-agent-guide) to learn how to call your agent.
